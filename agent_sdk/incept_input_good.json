        "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is B. 'Fluffy' is an adjective because adjectives describe nouns, and 'fluffy' describes the noun 'cat' by telling what kind of cat it is. Option A is incorrect because 'peacefully' is an adverb that describes the verb 'sleeps.' Option C is incorrect because 'cat' is a noun that names an animal. Option D is incorrect because 'sleeps' is a verb that shows the action the cat is doing."
