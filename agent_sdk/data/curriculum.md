Standard Description: Explain the function of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs in general and their functions in particular sentences.

Key Concepts:
*None specified*

Learning Objectives:
*None specified*

Assessment Boundaries:
* Assessment is limited to the five basic parts of speech (nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) and their functions in simple and compound sentences. Complex grammatical structures, verb tenses beyond simple present/past/future, or advanced pronoun types (reflexive, intensive) are not assessed.
* Students should explain general functions (e.g., "nouns name people, places, things" or "adjectives describe nouns") and identify specific functions in given sentences. Technical analysis of sentence diagrams or advanced grammatical terminology is not required.
* Assessment focuses on recognition and basic explanation of function. Students are not expected to generate complex sentences using all five parts of speech simultaneously or analyze abstract/literary uses of parts of speech.


Common Misconceptions:
* Students may confuse adjectives and adverbs, thinking any descriptive word is an adjective (e.g., calling 'quickly' an adjective because it describes).
* Students often think pronouns only replace people's names, not recognizing that pronouns can replace any noun including objects, animals, or places.
* Students might incorrectly believe that verbs only show physical action, missing linking verbs (is, are, was) and mental action verbs (think, know, believe).
* Students may identify words by their typical function rather than their actual function in a sentence (e.g., always calling 'run' a verb, even in 'a morning run' where it functions as a noun).
* Students often confuse the function of a word with its position in a sentence, thinking words at the beginning are always nouns/subjects or words at the end are always verbs.

Standard Description: Explain the function of nouns in general.

Key Concepts:
*None specified*

Learning Objectives:
*None specified*

Assessment Boundaries:
* Assessment focuses on students explaining that nouns name people, places, things, or ideas in general terms. Students are not required to classify nouns into subtypes (e.g., common vs. proper, concrete vs. abstract, singular vs. plural).
* Students should demonstrate understanding of nouns as a category of words that function as naming words. Technical grammatical terminology beyond basic noun function is not assessed.


Common Misconceptions:
* Students may confuse nouns with adjectives, thinking that any word describing something is a noun (e.g., believing 'big' or 'red' are nouns because they tell about things).
* Students often think that only tangible objects are nouns, not recognizing that ideas, feelings, or abstract concepts (like 'happiness' or 'friendship') can also be nouns.
* Students might incorrectly believe that nouns can only appear at the beginning of a sentence or must always be the subject.
* Students may think that verbs are nouns when the verb describes what a person or thing is doing (e.g., confusing 'run' as a noun in 'I run fast').
* Students might believe that proper names are not nouns because they start with capital letters and seem 'different' from regular nouns.

Standard Description: Explain the functions of adverbs in particular sentences.

Key Concepts:
*None specified*

Learning Objectives:
*None specified*

Assessment Boundaries:
* Assessment is limited to explaining how adverbs modify verbs (telling how, when, or where actions happen) in simple and compound sentences. Adverbs modifying adjectives or other adverbs are not assessed.
* Students should identify and explain the specific function of an adverb in context (e.g., "slowly tells how she walked"). Comparative and superlative forms of adverbs are not assessed.


Common Misconceptions:
* Students may confuse adverbs with adjectives, thinking words that describe are always adjectives regardless of what they modify.
* Students often think all adverbs end in -ly and may not recognize adverbs like "fast," "well," "always," or "here."
* Students might incorrectly believe adverbs can only tell "how" an action happens, missing that adverbs also tell "when" and "where."
* Students may identify an adverb correctly but explain its function incorrectly, such as saying it describes a noun instead of describing the verb.
* Students often confuse the placement of adverbs, thinking they must always come directly after the verb they modify.

Standard Description: Explain the function of pronouns in general.

Key Concepts:
*None specified*

Learning Objectives:
*None specified*

Assessment Boundaries:
* Assessment is limited to explaining the general function of pronouns (replacing nouns/noun phrases to avoid repetition). Identifying specific pronoun types (subject, object, possessive, reflexive, etc.) or using pronouns correctly in writing is not assessed.
* Students should explain functions in simple, general terms appropriate for Grade 3. Technical grammatical terminology beyond basic pronoun types is not assessed.


Common Misconceptions:
* Students may confuse pronouns with proper nouns because both can name people or things.
* Students often think pronouns can only replace people's names, not understanding they can replace any noun including objects, animals, or places.
* Students might incorrectly believe that pronouns are just shorter words for nouns, without understanding their function to avoid repetition.
* Students may think all small words like 'a', 'an', 'the', or 'it' are pronouns without distinguishing their different grammatical functions.
* Students often struggle to understand that pronouns must match what they replace (singular/plural, gender), thinking any pronoun can replace any noun.
