Option A incorrectly identifies a category relationship (both are types of music professionals) rather than maintaining the creator-to-creation structure.

Here, 'the novel' is the subject, but it doesn't perform the action of writing\u2014it receives the action. The passive construction 'was written' (be + past participle) shifts emphasis to the novel and the action of writing, while the actor (Maya Angelou) appears in a prepositional phrase. This demonstrates passive voice's rhetorical effect of emphasizing what was done rather than who did it. Students sometimes confuse passive voice with past tense, but the sentence is passive because of its structure (subject receives action), not because it describes past events. The passive voice is appropriate here when the focus should be on the literary work itself."

However, the scenario implies James can only handle mid-range complexity, not the high end required. Option A is incorrect because success with a mid-range text doesn't demonstrate proficiency at the high end. Option C reflects the misconception that the standard only requires reading at your exact grade level, not the high end of the band.

It identifies specific borrowed elements (the gift that benefits humanity, the consequence faced by the protagonist) and explains the transformations: fire becomes technological power, the setting shifts to corporate exploitation, and most importantly, the eternal punishment becomes a voluntary sacrifice with a liberating outcome. This analysis addresses both parts of the standard's requirement.\n\nOption A is incorrect because it only identifies the connection to source material without analyzing how the modern work transforms or renders it new\u2014a common misconception where students think identification alone is sufficient.\n\nOption B is incorrect because it assumes the modern work must follow the source material exactly, failing to recognize that adaptation involves creative transformation. The plots are actually quite different despite sharing thematic elements.\n\nOption D is incorrect because it confuses universal patterns and archetypes with specific, deliberate borrowing from an identifiable source. The author explicitly stated the Prometheus connection, making this a case of intentional adaptation rather than coincidental similarity."

This solution requires students to understand that efficiency means more than just adding links\u2014it means creating a organizational structure that shows how information relates across the document. The scenario requires understanding that comparing three energy sources across multiple criteria creates a complex information structure that readers need help navigating. While simple hyperlinks would work, they don't address the organizational challenge of presenting multi-dimensional comparisons efficiently. A basic table of contents without links wouldn't use technology effectively. Simply adding images or videos wouldn't help readers navigate the comparison structure. This answer requires students to think beyond single features and consider how technology can reveal information architecture, not just connect pages."

This transition is necessary because the passage presents two opposing urban planning strategies with contrasting outcomes. The first sentence describes mixed-use development and its benefit of reducing traffic, while the second sentence describes single-use zoning and its drawback of increasing traffic and automobile dependence. The relationship here is one of contrast between two different approaches and their opposite effects. Students may struggle with this because both sentences discuss urban planning concepts, which might make additive transitions like 'Additionally' seem appropriate. However, the key is recognizing that these aren't two examples supporting the same point, but rather two contrasting approaches with different consequences. The subtlety lies in understanding that discussing the same general topic (urban planning) doesn't mean the ideas are being added together\u2014they're being compared to show their differences."
