        "answer_explanation": "The correct answer is C. Pronouns are words that replace nouns or noun phrases so we don't have to repeat the same words over and over. For example, instead of saying 'Sarah went to Sarah's room because Sarah was tired,' we can say 'Sarah went to her room because she was tired.' The pronouns 'her' and 'she' replace 'Sarah' to avoid repetition. Pronouns can replace any noun, including people, animals, objects, or places."
