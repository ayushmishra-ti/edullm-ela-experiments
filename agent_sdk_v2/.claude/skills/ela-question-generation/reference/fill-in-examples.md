## Grade 3 Examples

### Example 1: Irregular Verbs (L.3.1.D)

```json
{
  "id": "l_3_1_d_fillin_easy_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "went",
    "question": "Complete the sentence with the correct past tense form of 'go':\n\nYesterday, Maria ______ to the library to return her books.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.3.1.D",
    "answer_explanation": "The word 'Yesterday' tells us the action happened in the past. The verb 'go' has an irregular past tense form. Instead of adding -ed, we change 'go' to 'went' to show past tense."
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Comparative Adjectives (L.3.1.G)

```json
{
  "id": "l_3_1_g_fillin_medium_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "faster",
    "question": "Choose the correct form of the adjective to complete the sentence:\n\nThe red bird flew ______ than the blue bird.\n\n(fast / faster / fastest)",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.3.1.G",
    "answer_explanation": "When comparing two things, we use the comparative form of an adjective. For short adjectives like 'fast,' we add -er to make the comparative form. Since we are comparing two birds, 'faster' is correct. 'Fastest' would be used when comparing three or more things."
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Superlative Adjectives (L.3.1.G)

```json
{
  "id": "l_3_1_g_fillin_hard_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "best",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the correct form of the adjective 'good':\n\nOf all the games I have played this year, that was the ______ one.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.3.1.G",
    "answer_explanation": "The phrase 'Of all the games' tells us we are comparing more than two things, so we need the superlative form. The adjective 'good' is irregular—it does not follow the usual -est pattern. The comparative form is 'better' and the superlative form is 'best.' Since we are comparing all the games, 'best' is the correct answer."
  }
}
```

### Example 4: Subject-Verb Agreement (L.3.1.F)

```json
{
  "id": "l_3_1_f_fillin_easy_002",
  "content": {
    "answer": "plays",
    "question": "Complete the sentence with the correct form of the verb 'play':\n\nMy sister ______ soccer every Saturday morning.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.3.1.F",
    "answer_explanation": "The subject 'My sister' is singular (one person), so we need a singular verb. For present tense verbs with singular subjects like 'he,' 'she,' or 'it,' we add -s to the base verb. Therefore, 'plays' is correct because it agrees with the singular subject."
  }
}
```

## Grade 5 Examples

### Example 1: Present Perfect Tense (L.5.1.B)

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_b_fillin_medium_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "have worked",
    "question": "Complete the sentence using the present perfect tense:\n\nWe ______ on this science project every day since we received the assignment.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "The present perfect tense describes an action that started in the past and continues to the present. It is formed using 'have' or 'has' plus the past participle. The phrase 'every day since we received the assignment' signals ongoing action from past to present. The subject 'We' requires 'have' (not 'has'), and the past participle of 'work' is 'worked.' Therefore, 'have worked' is correct."
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Past Perfect Tense (L.5.1.B)

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_b_fillin_hard_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "had finished",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the correct verb form:\n\nBy the time the bell rang, Sarah ______ her test.\n\n(finished / had finished / has finished)",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "The past perfect tense is used to show that one past action happened before another past action. 'By the time the bell rang' describes a past event, and Sarah completing her test happened before that. The past perfect is formed with 'had' plus the past participle. Therefore, 'had finished' correctly shows that Sarah completed her test before the bell rang."
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Verb Tense Consistency (L.5.1.D)

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_d_fillin_medium_002",
  "content": {
    "answer": "jumped",
    "question": "Choose the correct verb form to maintain consistent tense:\n\nThe dog ran across the yard, ______ over the fence, and landed in the neighbor's garden.\n\n(jumps / jumped / will jump)",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.D",
    "answer_explanation": "Verb tenses should remain consistent within a sentence unless there is a reason to shift. The sentence begins with 'ran' (past tense) and ends with 'landed' (past tense). To maintain consistency, the missing verb must also be in past tense. 'Jumped' is the past tense of 'jump,' making it the correct choice."
  }
}
```

### Example 4: Future Perfect Tense (L.5.1.B)

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_b_fillin_hard_002",
  "content": {
    "answer": "will have completed",
    "question": "Complete the sentence with the future perfect tense of 'complete':\n\nBy next Friday, our class ______ all of the required reading assignments.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "The future perfect tense describes an action that will be completed before a specific point in the future. It is formed using 'will have' plus the past participle. The phrase 'By next Friday' indicates a future deadline. The past participle of 'complete' is 'completed.' Therefore, 'will have completed' shows that the reading will be finished before next Friday."
  }
}
```

## Grade 6 Examples

### Example 1: Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement (L.6.1.A)

```json
{
  "id": "l_6_1_a_fillin_easy_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "they",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the correct pronoun:\n\nBecause Tyler and Emily enjoy traveling, ______ are planning a vacation to Germany.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.6.1.A",
    "answer_explanation": "A pronoun must agree with its antecedent (the noun it replaces) in number. The antecedent is 'Tyler and Emily,' which refers to two people (plural). The plural subject pronoun that replaces two or more people is 'they.' Using 'he' or 'she' would be incorrect because they are singular pronouns."
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Intensive Pronouns (L.6.1.B)

```json
{
  "id": "l_6_1_b_fillin_medium_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "herself",
    "question": "Complete the sentence with the correct intensive pronoun:\n\nThe author ______ visited our school to discuss her new book.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.6.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "An intensive pronoun emphasizes the noun or pronoun it refers to. Intensive pronouns end in -self (singular) or -selves (plural). The word 'author' is singular and refers to a female ('her new book'), so the intensive pronoun must be 'herself.' The intensive pronoun emphasizes that the actual author—not a representative—came to visit."
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Pronoun Case (L.6.1.A)

```json
{
  "id": "l_6_1_a_fillin_hard_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "whom",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the correct pronoun:\n\nThe student to ______ the award was given delivered an inspiring speech.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.6.1.A",
    "answer_explanation": "When a pronoun is the object of a preposition (like 'to'), we use the objective case. 'Who' is a subject pronoun, while 'whom' is an object pronoun. Since the pronoun follows the preposition 'to,' we need the object form 'whom.' A helpful test: if you can substitute 'him' or 'her,' use 'whom'; if you can substitute 'he' or 'she,' use 'who.' Here, 'the award was given to her' makes sense, so 'whom' is correct."
  }
}
```

### Example 4: Indefinite Pronouns (L.6.1.C)

```json
{
  "id": "l_6_1_c_fillin_medium_002",
  "content": {
    "answer": "his or her",
    "question": "Complete the sentence with the correct pronoun(s) to match the indefinite pronoun:\n\nEveryone in the class must bring ______ permission slip by Friday.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.6.1.C",
    "answer_explanation": "Indefinite pronouns like 'everyone,' 'someone,' and 'anybody' are grammatically singular, even though they may refer to multiple people. When a possessive pronoun refers back to a singular indefinite pronoun, we traditionally use 'his or her' for formal writing. This ensures the pronoun agrees in number with its singular antecedent 'everyone.'"
  }
}
```

## Grade 8 Examples

### Example 1: Gerunds (L.8.1.A)

```json
{
  "id": "l_8_1_a_fillin_easy_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "Swimming",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the gerund form of the verb 'swim':\n\n______ is excellent exercise for building cardiovascular endurance.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.8.1.A",
    "answer_explanation": "A gerund is a verb form ending in -ing that functions as a noun. In this sentence, the blank is the subject position (before 'is'), so we need a noun. 'Swimming' is the gerund form of 'swim' and functions as the subject of the sentence. Unlike a present participle, which acts as part of a verb phrase or an adjective, a gerund always functions as a noun."
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Infinitives (L.8.1.A)

```json
{
  "id": "l_8_1_a_fillin_medium_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "to improve",
    "question": "Complete the sentence with the correct infinitive:\n\nThe coach developed a new training program ______ the team's performance.\n\n(improving / to improve / improved)",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.8.1.A",
    "answer_explanation": "An infinitive is the base form of a verb preceded by 'to' (e.g., to run, to write). Infinitives can function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. In this sentence, the infinitive 'to improve' functions as an adverb, explaining the purpose of developing the training program. The phrase answers the question 'why?' or 'for what purpose?'—a key function of adverbial infinitives."
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Participles (L.8.1.A)

```json
{
  "id": "l_8_1_a_fillin_hard_001",
  "content": {
    "answer": "exhausted",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the correct participle form of 'exhaust':\n\n______ from the long hike, the climbers set up camp before sunset.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.8.1.A",
    "answer_explanation": "A participle is a verb form that functions as an adjective. Present participles end in -ing (exhausting), while past participles typically end in -ed (exhausted). In this sentence, the participle describes 'the climbers.' Since the climbers experienced exhaustion (they were affected by it), we use the past participle 'exhausted.' The present participle 'exhausting' would describe something that causes exhaustion in others."
  }
}
```

### Example 4: Active and Passive Voice (L.8.1.B)

```json
{
  "id": "l_8_1_b_fillin_medium_002",
  "content": {
    "answer": "was written",
    "question": "Rewrite the verb in passive voice to complete the sentence:\n\nThe Declaration of Independence ______ by Thomas Jefferson in 1776.\n\n(wrote / was written / has written)",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.8.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "In passive voice, the subject receives the action rather than performing it. Passive voice is formed using a form of 'be' plus the past participle. Here, 'The Declaration of Independence' is the subject receiving the action (it was written by someone). The past tense passive form requires 'was' (past tense of 'be') plus 'written' (past participle of 'write'). Therefore, 'was written' correctly expresses passive voice in the past tense."
  }
}
```

### Example 5: Verb Mood - Subjunctive (L.8.1.C)

```json
{
  "id": "l_8_1_c_fillin_hard_002",
  "content": {
    "answer": "were",
    "question": "Complete the sentence with the correct subjunctive form:\n\nIf I ______ the team captain, I would organize more practice sessions.\n\n(was / were / am)",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.8.1.C",
    "answer_explanation": "The subjunctive mood expresses wishes, hypothetical situations, demands, or conditions contrary to fact. In formal English, we use 'were' (not 'was') for all subjects in the subjunctive mood, even with singular subjects like 'I.' The sentence describes a hypothetical situation (the speaker is not actually the team captain), so the subjunctive 'were' is correct. This is why we say 'If I were you...' rather than 'If I was you...'"
  }
}
```

## High-Performing Fill-in Patterns

These patterns consistently achieve 90%+ scores in evaluation. They demonstrate how structural constraints eliminate ambiguity without always requiring word banks.

### Pattern A: Correlative Conjunction Completion (No Word Bank Needed)

When one half of a correlative pair is given, only one word can complete it.

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_e_fillin_easy_007",
  "content": {
    "answer": "nor",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the correct correlative conjunction: Neither the teacher __________ the students were ready for the fire drill.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.E",
    "answer_explanation": "The correlative conjunction pair 'neither/nor' is used to connect two negative options or choices. When 'Neither' introduces the first item, 'nor' must be used to introduce the second item to maintain proper grammatical parallelism."
  }
}
```

### Pattern B: Explicit Tense Instruction + Base Verb

Specify the exact tense required and provide the base verb form.

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_b_fillin_easy_007",
  "content": {
    "answer": "will have finished",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the future perfect form of the verb \"finish\": By tomorrow morning, the students __________ their art projects.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "The future perfect tense uses \"will have\" followed by the past participle of the verb. The past participle of \"finish\" is \"finished,\" so \"will have finished\" correctly shows an action that will be completed before a specific time in the future (tomorrow morning)."
  }
}
```

### Pattern C: Parenthetical Verb Hint

Provide the base verb in parentheses so students apply the transformation.

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_d_fillin_easy_009",
  "content": {
    "answer": "went",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the past-tense form of the verb in parentheses to keep the sentence in the same tense: 'Last weekend, we ________ (go) to the beach and built a sandcastle.'",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.D",
    "answer_explanation": "The time phrase 'Last weekend' and the past-tense verb 'built' establish that the sentence is in past tense. Therefore, the verb 'go' must be conjugated to its simple past form 'went' to maintain consistent verb tense and avoid an inappropriate shift."
  }
}
```

### Pattern D: Time Marker + Parallel Structure

Use temporal phrases and parallel verbs to constrain the answer.

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_c_fillin_easy_012",
  "content": {
    "answer": "howled",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the past tense of the verb in parentheses: Last night, the wind __________ (howl) through the trees.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.C",
    "answer_explanation": "The phrase 'Last night' establishes a specific past time, requiring the simple past tense of the verb. For regular verbs like 'howl,' the past tense is formed by adding -ed to the base verb, resulting in 'howled' to correctly show the action occurred in the past."
  }
}
```

### Pattern E: Perfect Tense with Temporal Boundary

Use "By the time" or similar phrases to force perfect tense.

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_b_fillin_hard_008",
  "content": {
    "answer": "will have driven",
    "question": "By the time the storm makes landfall tonight, the coastal residents __________ to higher ground. (Fill in the blank with the correct perfect-tense form of the verb 'drive' based on the context.)",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "The phrase 'By the time the storm makes landfall tonight' establishes a future reference point, requiring the future perfect tense to show an action completed before that moment. Future perfect is formed with 'will have' plus the past participle. The past participle of the irregular verb 'drive' is 'driven,' making 'will have driven' the only correct form to demonstrate mastery of perfect tense sequencing."
  }
}
```

### Pattern F: Tense Correction with Context Clues

Provide surrounding verbs that establish the required tense.

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_d_fillin_easy_006",
  "content": {
    "answer": "helped",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the correct past-tense form of the verb in parentheses to fix the inappropriate shift in verb tense.\nYesterday, my sister finished her homework and __________ (help) me with my math problems.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.D",
    "answer_explanation": "The time marker 'Yesterday' and the past-tense verb 'finished' establish that the sentence describes past events. Changing 'help' to 'helped' maintains consistent past tense throughout, correcting the inappropriate shift from past to present tense."
  }
}
```

### Pattern G: Present Perfect with Ongoing Action Signal

Use "since" or "already" to signal present perfect.

```json
{
  "id": "l_5_1_b_fillin_easy_005",
  "content": {
    "answer": "has planted",
    "question": "Fill in the blank with the present perfect tense form of the verb in parentheses: The gardener __________ (plant) all the flowers already.",
    "image_url": [],
    "additional_details": "CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.5.1.B",
    "answer_explanation": "The present perfect tense for a singular third-person subject like 'the gardener' uses 'has' followed by the past participle of the verb. The past participle of the regular verb 'plant' is 'planted,' so the correct form is 'has planted.'"
  }
}
```

## Key Principles for High-Quality Fill-in Questions

### 1. Clear Blank Placement
- Use underscores (______) to indicate where the answer goes
- Place the blank where it naturally fits in the sentence
- Avoid ambiguous blank placement

### 2. Precise Answers
- The answer should be a single word or short phrase
- Accept only one correct answer (or specify acceptable alternatives)
- Ensure the answer directly tests the target skill

### 3. Context Clues
- Provide enough context to guide students toward the correct answer
- Include signal words when appropriate (e.g., "Yesterday" for past tense)
- For harder questions, reduce context clues

### 4. Educational Explanations
- Explain WHY the answer is correct, not just WHAT it is
- Reference the grammar rule being tested
- Explain why wrong alternatives would be incorrect
- NEVER reference answer options A/B/C/D (fill-ins don't have options)

### 5. Grade-Appropriate Content
- Use vocabulary suitable for the grade level
- Match sentence complexity to the target grade
- Topics should be familiar and relatable to students

### 6. Structural Constraint Strategy
- Use grammatical patterns that permit only one valid completion
- Correlative pairs, explicit tense instructions, and parenthetical verb hints reduce ambiguity
- Word banks are a fallback when structure alone cannot constrain the answer
