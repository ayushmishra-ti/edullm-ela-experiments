## Verbals (Gerunds, Participles, Infinitives)

### Definitions

| Verbal Type | Form | Function | Example |
|-------------|------|----------|---------|
| **Gerund** | verb + -ing | Functions as a **NOUN** | *Swimming* is fun. (subject) |
| **Participle** | verb + -ing OR verb + -ed/-en | Functions as an **ADJECTIVE** | The *broken* vase... / The *running* water... |
| **Infinitive** | to + base verb | Functions as noun, adjective, or adverb | I want *to swim*. |

### Critical Distinctions

#### Gerund vs. Present Participle (Both end in -ing)

```
GERUND (noun function):
  "Swimming is my favorite activity."
  → "Swimming" = subject of the sentence (noun role)
  → Test: Can replace with "it" → "It is my favorite activity" ✓

PRESENT PARTICIPLE (adjective function):
  "The swimming child laughed."
  → "swimming" = modifies "child" (adjective role)
  → Test: Describes a noun ✓

PRESENT PARTICIPLE (part of progressive verb):
  "The child is swimming."
  → "is swimming" = progressive verb phrase (auxiliary + participle)
  → Test: Shows ongoing action with auxiliary verb ✓
```

#### Common Misconception: Progressive Tense vs. Gerund

```
WRONG: "In 'Swimming is fun,' 'Swimming' is part of a progressive verb."
RIGHT: "In 'Swimming is fun,' 'Swimming' is a gerund functioning as the subject."

Progressive tense requires: auxiliary verb (is/am/are/was/were) + present participle
  - "She is swimming" = progressive (auxiliary + participle)
  - "Swimming is fun" = gerund as subject (no auxiliary before the -ing word)
```

#### Catenative Verbs (continue, start, begin, keep, stop)

```
"She continued swimming."
  → "continued" = finite verb (main verb of the sentence)
  → "swimming" = present participle in a non-finite complement clause
  → This is NOT progressive tense (progressive would be "was continuing")

"He started running."
  → "started" = finite verb
  → "running" = gerund OR present participle (grammatically ambiguous, both analyses valid)
```

### Past Participles

```
Regular: verb + -ed (walked, talked, played)
Irregular: verb + -en or changed form (broken, written, sung, gone)

"The broken promises hurt her."
  → "broken" = past participle functioning as adjective modifying "promises"

"The letter was written yesterday."
  → "written" = past participle in passive voice construction
```

### Participial Phrases

```
"Exhausted from the race, Maria collapsed."
  → "Exhausted from the race" = participial phrase modifying "Maria"
  → Functions as ADJECTIVE (describes Maria's state)

"Running quickly, the dog caught the ball."
  → "Running quickly" = participial phrase modifying "dog"
  → Functions as ADJECTIVE
```

### Participial Phrases as Adverbials

**IMPORTANT: Participial clauses CAN function adverbially.**

```
"The noise continued, making sleep impossible."
  → "making sleep impossible" = participial clause
  → Functions ADVERBIALLY (shows result/consequence of the main clause)
  → Modifies the entire preceding clause, not just a noun

"Having finished her homework, she went outside."
  → "Having finished her homework" = perfect participial phrase
  → Functions ADVERBIALLY (shows time/sequence)
```

### Bare Infinitives

```
"She helped him carry the boxes."
  → "carry" = bare infinitive (infinitive without "to")
  → Follows certain verbs: help, make, let, have, see, hear, watch, feel

"I saw her leave."
  → "leave" = bare infinitive after perception verb "saw"
```

## L.8.1.B: Active and Passive Voice

### Definitions

```
ACTIVE VOICE: Subject performs the action
  "The dog bit the man."
  → Subject (dog) → Verb (bit) → Object (man)

PASSIVE VOICE: Subject receives the action
  "The man was bitten by the dog."
  → Subject (man) ← receives action ← Agent (dog)
```

### Passive Voice Formation

```
Passive = form of "be" + past participle (+ optional "by" phrase)

Active: "Scientists discovered the cure."
Passive: "The cure was discovered (by scientists)."

Active: "The committee is reviewing the proposal."
Passive: "The proposal is being reviewed (by the committee)."
```

### Identifying Voice

| Voice | Subject Role | Verb Structure | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Active | Doer of action | Simple verb | "Maria wrote the essay." |
| Passive | Receiver of action | be + past participle | "The essay was written by Maria." |

### Common Passive Constructions by Tense

```
Simple Present: "The report is written daily."
Simple Past: "The report was written yesterday."
Present Progressive: "The report is being written now."
Past Progressive: "The report was being written when I arrived."
Present Perfect: "The report has been written."
Past Perfect: "The report had been written before the meeting."
Future: "The report will be written tomorrow."
```

## L.8.1.C: Verb Moods

### The Five Moods

| Mood | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Indicative** | States facts or asks questions | "She writes every day." / "Does she write?" |
| **Imperative** | Gives commands or requests | "Write your essay now." |
| **Interrogative** | Asks questions (subset of indicative) | "Did you finish the assignment?" |
| **Conditional** | Expresses hypothetical results | "She would write if she had time." |
| **Subjunctive** | Expresses wishes, demands, suggestions, hypotheticals | "I wish she were here." / "I suggest he leave." |

### Subjunctive Mood (Most Tested)

#### Contrary-to-Fact / Hypothetical Conditions

```
SUBJUNCTIVE "were" (not "was") for hypotheticals:
  "If I were a bird, I would fly." ✓
  "If I was a bird, I would fly." ✗ (incorrect for formal writing)

  "If she were here, she would help." ✓
  "I wish I were taller." ✓

Rule: Use "were" for ALL subjects in hypothetical "if" clauses and "wish" statements.
```

#### Mandative Subjunctive (demands, suggestions, requirements)

```
Use BASE FORM of verb after verbs of demand/suggestion/requirement:

"I suggest that he LEAVE immediately." (not "leaves")
"The teacher demanded that she BE quiet." (not "is" or "was")
"It is essential that every student SUBMIT the work." (not "submits")

Trigger verbs: suggest, recommend, demand, require, insist, ask, propose, request
Trigger adjectives: essential, important, necessary, vital, crucial
```

### Conditional Mood

```
Would/could/should/might + base verb = conditional

"She would go if she had time."
"He could help if you asked."
"They should leave before dark."

Conditional expresses what WOULD happen under certain conditions.
```

### Common Errors

```
ERROR: "If I would have known, I would have called."
CORRECT: "If I had known, I would have called."
(Use past perfect in the "if" clause, not "would have")

ERROR: "I wish I was there."
CORRECT: "I wish I were there."
(Use subjunctive "were" after "wish")
```

## L.8.1.D: Inappropriate Shifts in Voice and Mood

### Voice Shifts

```
INAPPROPRIATE SHIFT (active → passive):
  "The students completed their projects, and then the presentations were given."
  → First clause: active ("students completed")
  → Second clause: passive ("presentations were given")

CORRECTED (consistent active):
  "The students completed their projects, and then they gave the presentations."

CORRECTED (consistent passive):
  "The projects were completed by the students, and then the presentations were given."
```

### Mood Shifts

```
INAPPROPRIATE SHIFT (indicative → imperative):
  "The report explains the data, and include a summary at the end."
  → "explains" = indicative
  → "include" = imperative

CORRECTED:
  "The report explains the data and includes a summary at the end." (both indicative)
  OR
  "Explain the data in the report and include a summary at the end." (both imperative)
```

---

## L.8.2.A: Punctuation for Pause or Break

### Comma

```
Use for: Brief pause, separating items, introductory elements
  "After the storm, the sun came out."
  "She bought apples, oranges, and bananas."
```

### Dash (Em Dash —)

```
Use for: Abrupt break, emphasis, or parenthetical information
  "The answer—if there is one—remains unclear."
  "She finally answered—after a long pause—that she would go."

Stronger break than comma, more emphatic than parentheses.
```

### Ellipsis (...)

```
Use for: Trailing off, hesitation, or omission
  "I was thinking that maybe..."
  "The original text stated, 'Four score and seven years ago...our fathers brought forth.'"
```

### Comparison

| Punctuation | Pause Strength | Effect |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Comma | Mild | Brief pause, smooth flow |
| Dash | Strong | Abrupt break, emphasis |
| Ellipsis | Suspended | Trailing off, omission |

---

## L.8.2.B: Ellipsis for Omission

### In Quotations

```
Original: "The committee decided, after much deliberation and debate, to approve the proposal."

With ellipsis: "The committee decided...to approve the proposal."
→ Shows words have been omitted for brevity

Spacing: No space before, one space after (or use three-dot character …)
```

### For Trailing Off

```
"I was going to tell you, but..."
→ Shows incomplete thought or hesitation
```

---

## L.8.2.C: Spelling

### Common Spelling Rules

```
i before e except after c: believe, receive, ceiling
Drop silent e before vowel suffix: hope → hoping, write → writing
Double consonant after short vowel: run → running, stop → stopped
Change y to i before suffix: happy → happiness, carry → carried (except -ing: carrying)
```

---

## L.8.3.A: Mood for Effect

### Using Mood Rhetorically

```
Indicative for facts: "Climate change affects weather patterns."
Imperative for urgency: "Act now to protect our planet."
Conditional for possibility: "We could solve this if we worked together."
Subjunctive for wishes: "If only everyone were more aware..."

Writers choose mood to create specific effects on the reader.
```

## Quick Reference: Common Errors to Avoid in Explanations

### ❌ Incorrect Claims

1. "Gerunds are verbs." → ❌ Gerunds are verbals that function as NOUNS.

2. "'Swimming' in 'Swimming is fun' is part of a progressive verb." → ❌ It's a gerund (subject). Progressive requires auxiliary + participle.

3. "Participles only function as adjectives." → ❌ Participial clauses can function adverbially.

4. "Use 'was' for first person singular in hypotheticals." → ❌ Use "were" for ALL subjects in subjunctive.

5. "'Continued haunting' is past progressive." → ❌ "Continued" is the finite verb; "haunting" is a participle in a complement clause.

### ✅ Correct Terminology

- Finite verb: The main conjugated verb (shows tense, agrees with subject)
- Non-finite verb: Verbals (gerunds, participles, infinitives) - no tense marking
- Complement clause: A clause that completes the meaning of another verb
- Progressive aspect: Auxiliary (be) + present participle showing ongoing action
- Participial phrase: Participle + its modifiers/complements, functioning as adjective or adverb
